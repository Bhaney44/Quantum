# Quantum
Repository to developing quantum software for cracking SHA-256.

# Problem
How to solve SHA-256 with a quantum computer.

# Solution Approach
Our goal is to advance the edge in quantum cryptopgraphy for the purpose of mining digital assets with a quantum computer.

# Motivation
Quantum computing provides a solution for solving SHA-256 by means other than brute force, which will provide a cost-efficiency improvement in mining.

# Quantum Computing
A quantum computer is a physical system harnessing quantum effects to perform computation. Quantum computers differ from classical computers because of the way in which they process information. Classical computers process information with bits, a binary representation. However, quantum
computers process information with qubits, which represent information in a complex vector space.

The qubit is an innovation advancing the goal to improve the efficiency and power of classical computing methodologies with quantum mechanics. A qubit may represent a zero, one, or zero and one simultaneously in a state of superposition. The qubit allows for faster computing and less electrical
power consumption compared to its classical counterpart.
