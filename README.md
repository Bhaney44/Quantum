# Quantum
Repository to developing quantum software for cracking SHA-256.

# Problem
How to solve SHA-256 with a quantum computer.

# Solution Approach
Our goal is to advance the edge in quantum cryptopgraphy for the purpose of mining digital assets with a quantum computer.

# Motivation
Quantum computing provides a solution for solving SHA-256 by means other than brute force, which will provide a cost-efficiency improvement in mining.
